# GreatStack.SocialBook

This is a Full Stack Social Networking Website (built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Socket.io which is packed up with rich features like Register/Login User, Create Posts and Stories, Like, Comment, Add Friends, Real-Time Chat with Online Friends and Much More) during my internship as a "Software Engineering Intern" under Risewings Technologies LLP, Bangalore, India.

# To Run This Project:

1. Run the MongoDB Server (type "mongod" in cmd)
2. Run the Node Server (use "node app.js" in api's terminal)
3. Run the Socket Server (use "npm start" in socket's terminal)
4. Run the React Server (use "npm start" in client's terminal)

Now the Website will be hosted on localhost:3000
